# Creating a serverless Movie API

### In this project, I am creating a serverless api that performs the following functions:
- GetMovies: Returns a JSON list of all movies in your db. Make sure to return a URL for the movie cover.
- GetMoviesByYear: Returns a list of movies released in that year. Year is provided by the client.
- EXTRA CREDIT: GetMovieSummary: Returns a summary that is generated by AI.

## Process
- Installed Azure Management Resources, Azure Management Compute, Azure Management Storage, and Azure Management Cosmos(DB) packages.
    - I had a little issue w/ Cosmos DB package installer bc of an out dated version. Troubleshooting was a bit tricky.
