In this capstone project, I am going to create a CLI tool using Bash that the user can easily use to upload files to an Azure storage.
## Below are a list of what I have achieved with this project.
- Write a bash script to automate file upload.
    - The script checks to make sure the Azure cli tool has be installed before proceeding.
    - The program can accept input for the storage account and conainer name.
    - The program is flexible.
- File Check:
    - The program checks to make sure the file been uploaded is available.
- File Upload:
    - The program uploads Files to Azure cloud.
- Upload Feedback:
    - The program provides a feedback at the end of execution.
